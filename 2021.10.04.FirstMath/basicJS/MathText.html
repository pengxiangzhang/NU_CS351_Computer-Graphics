In-class activity
============================================================================
1)  Look in the 'lib' directory.  There you'll find the library file 
'cuon-matrix-quat03.js', an extended version of the book's rudimentary 
vector/matrix library ('cuon-matrix.js'). 
 
2) Explore this 'cuon-matrix-quat03.js' library.  
In it you'll find objects 'Vector3', 'Vector4' and 'Matrix4',
which each have member functions to help you manipulate 
3x1 vectors, 4x1 vectors and 4x4 matrices useful for computer graphics work,
as well as a 'quaternion' object we will use later for animating rotations.

3) Search this file for the string 'console', and you'll find the 'Matrix4'
object and several others has a 'printMe()' member function.  Try it!  

?HOW SHOULD I 'TRY IT'? 
at the bottom of main(), create a new 'Matrix4' object, and use one of its 
'setXXX()' member functions to initialize the matrix to some desirable set of
values.  
Can you create and print an identity matrix?  
A 'translate' matrix?
A 'scale' matrix?
A 'rotation' matrix?

4) Next, see if you can create and print a Vector3 object and a Vector4 object,
and again use the 'printMe()' method to confirm their contents.

5) Next, try out some basic vector/vector operations.
--Create two different Vector4 objects with nonzero elements.  
Compute and print their lengths in the console window. 
Can any Vector4 member function compute that for you?  
(or should you add a new member fcn for that?)  
Can you normalize these vectors?

--Can you compute a 'dotProduct()' for two Vector4 objects?  
Why do we get a warning if either vector has a non-zero 'w' component?

--Can you compute a 'crossProduct()' for two Vector4 objects? 
Why do we get a warning if either vector has a non-zero 'w' component?

--In the Matrix4 object, 
	what's the difference between 'rotate()' and 'setRotate()' members?
--What other vector/matrix operations should you test?
